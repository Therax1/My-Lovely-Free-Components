# Navbars 
I've created some responsive navigation bars for different types of websites. You can view their clear descriptions and see their preview.
#### 1- E-commerce Navbar with expand Search bar on Mobile (v1.0.0)
This navigation bar contains:
- A search bar that expands when the search bar is focused on mobile...Overlay is available for both mobile and desktop devices.
- A link to the homepage or whatever you want.
- A shopping cart icon that opens a sidebar (the icon is not functional).

Next Feature:
- Dark Mode Toggle button
